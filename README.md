# Ride_Hailing_Analysis

**Jupyter Notebook**

**Overview**

**Objective:**

Understand demand–supply dynamics, cancellation drivers, revenue patterns, and weather impacts in Uber rides to inform operational and pricing strategies.

**Data Cleaning:**

Parsed timestamps; normalized location names; handled missing pickup/drop times (for cancelled/no-cars trips); computed “wait time” and “trip duration” features; encoded categorical variables.

**Data Analysis:**

Examined temporal demand (hour/day), ride-type popularity, cancellation rates by time and location, revenue breakdown by ride type, and weather correlations.

**Data Visualization:**

Created heatmaps of requests vs. hour and pickup zone; line charts of request volume over time; bar charts of cancellation rates; box plots of trip durations and wait times; scatter plots of revenue vs. ride type.

**Insights:**

Peak-hour supply shortfalls drive “No Cars Available” alerts and cancellations, especially in congested zones. Rainy weather spikes cancellation rates by ~20%. UberXL, though only ~33% of trips, contributes ~40% of revenue.

**Deliverable:**

A fully annotated Jupyter Notebook with summarized actionable findings and recommendations.
